                    <h2>Terminal Device Driver - C</h2>
                    <p>Developed a device driver that manages keyboard input from a user and output from user processes. 
                        The device driver uses a Mesa monitor to ensure that access to the terminals do not cause data races, 
                        while still being able to manage multiple terminals at once. The driver uses conditional variables 
                        to ensure that multiple processes and the user cannot write to one terminal at the same time.</p>

                    <h2>M3ssag1n8 - HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Go</h2>
                    <p>Worked with a group to create a messaging website. Users can create and modify workspaces, channels, 
                        and add posts to channels. Workspaces, channels, and posts are stored in a database made with Go. 
                        Both the database and the messaging site were made with concurrency in mind, ensuring that there will 
                        be no data races, deadlock or livelock.</p>

                    <p>Along with a partner, I recreated the malloc, free, and realloc routines used in C. In our implementation, 
                        we used explicit free lists that were organized into bins of a certain size. This increases efficiency, 
                        because only bins of a similar size need to be searched.</p>
